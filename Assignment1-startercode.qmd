# 1 Introduction

Planning for high school and preparing for college applications can be extremely complex for students who lack experience and support, particularly for those from low-income and underrepresented groups. However, providing these students with adequate information and guidance can encourage them to apply to and gain admission to colleges with richer educational resources and higher academic standards \[3\]. The High School Handbook developed by STEMBuddies has the potential to provide such guidance. To more effectively support students in their academic planning, financial needs, and personal development, it is necessary to collect feedback from current students on the handbook to assess their needs and preferences.

This report outlines the design and analysis of a survey created to assess the needs of high school students and their preferences. By using best practices in survey design \[1\], the survey provides actionable insights for STEMBuddies to improve the handbook accessibility, inclusivity, and their overall impact.

# 2 Survey Showcasing

## 2.1 Survey Description

Our survey, hosted on <https://forms.gle/sWqTQ1HCXPrjkk6BA>, is designed to gather insights from high school students. This survey focuses on evaluating how the handbook helps for academic planning, personal growth and looking for specific resources or supports, and what the students expect for a useful handbook. The survey consists of the following sections:

1.  **Introduction**: A brief description of STEMBuddies and purpose of the survey.
2.  **Core Questions**: Demographic questions, needs-assessment questions, and program feedback prompts.
3.  **Closing Message**: Thanks participants and provides contact information.

## 2.2 Testing My Survey

Each question was designed to minimize ambiguity and cognitive load. For example, we avoided double-barreled items and ensured that the survey was focused and concise \[1\]. We piloted the survey with three peers in different grade levels and incorporated feedback to refine clarity and ease of responsiveness. Based on the feedback, we improved on word selection and question setting.

## 2.3 Showcasing Relevant Question(s)

A key survey question is showcased below:

*Which of the following resources would be most valuable to you in the STEMBuddies program? (Select up to three options)*

-   Academic Tutoring
-   College Application Guidance
-   Career Counseling
-   Mental Health Support
-   Time Management Skills
-   Financial Literacy
-   Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We chose this question because it provides insight into what our target population may be seeking in the handbook and helps us better understand their needs.

The benefit of this type of question is that the multiple-choice format, combined with an ‘Other’ option, provides both structure and flexibility. It allows participants to choose from common resources while also giving them space to share needs that may not be listed. However, a drawback is that some nuanced or specific needs might still be overlooked, either because participants do not think to write them in or because they feel limited by the predefined options. This drawback is unavoidable while we want to keep the answering process easy and short, but the following question ("What challenges or barriers are preventing you from pursuing STEM?") may help us understand the students' needs better.

# 3 Procedure

## 3.1 Proposed Sampling Procedure

To collect survey feedback, we propose a stratified random sampling procedure targeting high school students across Canada, with the individual student serving as the sampling unit \[5\]. The survey will be distributed to students via partnerships with high schools, provincial boards, mailing lists, STEM clubs, outreach initiatives, and educational organizations that cater to diverse student populations in order to acquire the sampling frame. The survey can be conducted in-class with teacher oversight to boost response rates or online using unique survey links shared through schools and partner organizations.

This method guarantees representation across various strata such as geographic area, school category (public or private), and socioeconomic level. The sampling frame is limited but feasible. Potential biases include **coverage bias** (because some schools or students may not be included in the frame), **self-selection bias** (students who volunteer to answer the questionnaire might be more interested or motivated in high school planning, which means they possibly have more information on covered topics and underestimate/overestimate the helpfulness of specific topics), **non-response bias** (students who are absent or less engaged choose not to participate), and **limited internet access in rural or low-income areas** \[4\].

## 3.2 Simulation

We simulate survey responses for 100 students to mirror the showcased resource-preference question. Each simulated respondent selects up to three resources from the options provided in the survey. This process ensures that the simulated dataset reflects the structure and response style of the actual survey, while still being reproducible through the use of a fixed random seed. By generating these responses, we create a realistic dataset that can be analyzed to demonstrate the kinds of insights STEMBuddies could obtain if the survey were administered in practice.

```{r, include = FALSE}

set.seed(1234)
n <- 100
resources <- c("Academic Tutoring", "College Application Guidance", "Career Counseling",
               "Mental Health Support", "Time Management Skills", "Financial Literacy", "Other")

# Ensure unique selections for each student
sim_data <- tibble(id = 1:n) %>%
  rowwise() %>%  # Process each row individually
  mutate(
    resource1 = sample(resources, 1, replace = FALSE, prob = c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1)),  # First resource. We expect "Other" option is less likely to be selected.
    resource2 = sample(resources, 1, replace = FALSE, prob = c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1)),  # Second resource (unique)
    resource3 = sample(resources, 1, replace = FALSE, prob = c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1))  # Third resource (unique)
  ) %>%
  select(id, resource1, resource2, resource3)  # Keep only the needed columns

```

# 4 Data

## 4.1 Data Cleaning and Processing

The dataset consists of simulated survey responses from 100 high school students. Each student was asked to select up to three resources they would find most valuable from a list that included options such as Academic Tutoring, College Application Guidance, and Financial Literacy.

To prepare the data for analysis, we reshaped the responses into a long format, where each selected resource for a student appeared as a separate entry. This helps us to summarize selections across all students. Next, we converted the data into a binary format, creating separate indicator variables for each resource. In this structure, a value of 1 indicates that a student selected the resource, and 0 indicates they did not.

The main variables are the binary indicators for each resource, showing whether a student selected it. This cleaned format allows for consistent, reproducible analysis of overall resource preferences.

```{r, include = FALSE}

sim_data_clean <- sim_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("resource"), names_to = "resource_num", values_to = "resource") %>%
  select(-resource_num)

# Create binary-coded dataset
sim_data_binary <- sim_data_clean %>%
  mutate(value = 1) %>%
  complete(id, resource, fill = list(value = 0)) %>%  # Fill missing with 0
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = id,
    names_from = resource,
    values_from = value 
  )
```

## 4.2 Variables of Interest

The main analysis focuses on the survey question: “Which of the following resources would be most valuable to you in the STEMBuddies program? (Select up to three options).” Each resource is represented as a binary-coded variable (0 = not selected, 1 = selected). The key variables analyzed are: Academic Tutoring, College Application Guidance, Career Counseling, Mental Health Support, Time Management Skills, Financial Literacy, and Other. These variables form the core of the main analysis, allowing us to calculate the frequency and proportion of students selecting each resource, visualize student preferences, and compute confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty around these proportions.

## 4.3 Figures

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo = FALSE}

sim_data_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resource)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", col = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Resource",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Figure 1: Frequency of Resource Preferences Among High School Students") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

Figure 1 shows the number of students who selected each resource from the survey. The x-axis lists all possible resources, while the y-axis represents the number of students selecting each option. Among the listed resources, *Time Management Skills* had the highest frequency of selection, while *Others* had the lowest. This figure clearly highlights which resources are most frequently requested, providing STEMBuddies with a visual summary of student preferences. For example, taller bars indicate higher demand for a particular resource, helping to prioritize support areas in the handbook.

## 4.4 Data Summary for Confidence Interval Analysis

The cleaned survey data allows us to calculate the proportion of students who selected each resource. With the variables coded as 0 or 1, these proportions give a clear view of student demand. This summary also provides useful information for constructing confidence intervals, which highlight the uncertainty in our estimates and how they may generalize to the broader student population.

# 5 Methods

To estimate the proportion of students who prefer a specific resource, we will use the following formula for a 95% confidence interval for a population proportion: $$CI = \hat{p} \pm z^*  \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$where $\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, $z^∗$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution (z-score) corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence), and n is the sample size \[2\]. The value under the square root represents the standard error, reflecting the variability expected from repeated student sampling, and multiplying it by $z^∗$ gives the margin of error. This method assumes a large enough sample size to support the normal approximation and that student responses are independent of each other. With these conditions, a 95% confidence interval indicates that if the survey were repeated many times, about 95% of the constructed intervals would capture the true population proportion.

# 6 Results

```{r, include = FALSE}

n <- nrow(sim_data_clean)
p_hat <- sim_data_clean %>% filter(resource == "Academic Tutoring") %>% nrow() / n
z_star <- 1.96
margin_of_error <- z_star * sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)
ci_lower <- p_hat - margin_of_error
ci_upper <- p_hat + margin_of_error

cat("Proportion of students preferring Academic Tutoring:", round(p_hat, 2), "\n")
cat("95% Confidence Interval: (", round(ci_lower, 2), ",", round(ci_upper, 2), ")\n")

```

| Resource          | Proportion of Students | 95% Confidence Interval |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Academic Tutoring | 0.15                   | (0.11, 0.19)            |

: The proportion and 95% confidence interval of students preferring "Academic Tutoring".

Interpretation: For example, 15% of students in our sample selected "Academic Tutoring" as a valuable resource, and the confidence interval suggests that the true proportion is likely between 11% and 19%.

# 7 Generative AI Statement

Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used to help structure this report, generate simulation code, and ensure clarity of statistical explanations. AI was also used selectively to enhance grammar, improve clarity of expression, and suggest alternative phrasing for technical material. All simulated data generation, results, and interpretation were conducted independently by the authors. Although AI can enhance clarity and efficiency, it has notable limitations: its outputs may include factual or methodological errors, and it lacks the critical reasoning required for proper statistical validation. To address this concern, all AI-generated outputs were thoroughly reviewed, verified against course materials and reliable sources, and rewritten or adapted to reflect the authors’ own understanding.
